I was working on the main page functionality.

the routing of the main page is setup allowing the transition between the three different states ('home', 'search', 'item')

each state has its own .ejs file stored in views/main/...
where each of them are only shown if the relevant variable exists

home state is pretty much complete functionally using Alan's db queries

search state basic functionality complete where type in search in searchbar and it finds all listings that contain that string and is case insensitive

item state started basic functionality with hardcode button to go to a specific item. 

still TODO main page
- functionality to select any shown item(maybe add id to each row)
- search state
	- drop down selection to filter based on the brand
	- range slider to filter items based on maximum price
- item state
	- db queries
	- get full name of seller
	- initially only show 3 reviews
	- show more reviews button
	- limit review comments to 200 characters
	- show more in comments
	- add to cart
	- box with currently added quantity


other things
- I think the validation is probably more a controller than a routes
